The speaker is an expert in adaptation and has experience working in the least developed countries of Africa and Asia. They are praising Bangladesh for being ahead of others in terms of adaptation, implying that the policies in place are working. The code 4.2 is the most applicable as it suggests that climate policies are ineffective or flawed, which is not the case in this text.

We are going to get more or less GHG regulation over time depending on who is in the White House and whether the particular GHG regulations that EPA issues are legally defensible.

My own view is that EPAs latest GHG proposal, for new source performance standards for coal-based electric generation, is not legally defensible and will be overturned in Court.

We need to separate these results of model experiments - of course that's all they are are experiments with models, from scenarios of how CO2 will increase. These are two separate issues. As far as I can tell from the IPCC report, their estimate or their numbers for the what is call the \"climate sensitivity\" that is, how much temperature rise will be produced by doubling of CO2 alone, all other things being equal, has not changed since 1990. It is still estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 C for a doubling of CO2. And what Roy has addressed here is the fact that this is probably a faulty estimate because they have not taken into account the reduced feedback, perhaps even negative feedback, of water vapor and reduced, perhaps even negative feedback of clouds. So the climate sensitivity is the one we are interested in. I think many of us believe that these numbers, that the IPCC has given, are just plain wrong.\n",

The text presents a specific situation where a climate-friendly measure (using bio-diesel) has led to an unexpected problem, but it does not question the overall importance of reducing emissions. It falls under code '3.3' because it presents a situation where a climate-friendly action (using bio-diesel) has an unintended negative consequence, although it does not say that CO2 is beneficial or not a pollutant.

The result is that large segments of the American electorate feel that the administration and Democrats in Congress don't understand and don't care to understand their aspirations and fears.
