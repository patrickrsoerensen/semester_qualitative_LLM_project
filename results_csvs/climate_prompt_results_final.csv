6,"Rather than one guess being applicable to all measurements, I ended up needing four different groups each with a different guessed deflation. A good guess (i.e. one that worked) for the majority of balls (7) was 0.38 psi an interesting number that Ill discuss in the post. A good guess for two balls was zero deflation. But for ball #7, it was necessary to assume that it had been inflated by approximately 0.5 psiin the washroom. One ball was lower than the others (0.76 psi) and remains hard to explain. The Wells Report reasonably drew attention to variability, but did not address the details of actual variability other than arm-waving and did not actually show that erratic washroom deflation was a plausible explanation for observed variability.",0.0,0.0,0.0,Reasoning: The text does not mention anything related to climate change or any of the codes in the codebook.,0.0,"```

The main claim of this text is that the Wells Report did not adequately address the variability in deflation of footballs, and the evidence presented is the author's own experiment with different deflation guesses for different balls.

This aligns with code 5.2, which pertains to skepticism of the climate movement and its perceived biases.",5.2,"```

The main claim of this text is that the Climategate scandal illustrates that climate researchers are human and prone to bias, which does not invalidate the IPCC's case for global warming but does highlight the potential for bias in climate research.

The evidence for this claim is the Climategate scandal, which is presented as an example of how climate researchers can be biased.

Based on this, the text matches code 5.2 because it suggests that the climate movement (or at least some climate researchers) are biased, which is a criticism of the climate movement rather than a denial of climate change itself."
12,"Increasing the air temperature by 2C increased ecosystem evapotranspiration ; but the imposition of twice-ambient atmospheric CO 2 concentrations reduced this impact of the temperature increase while simultaneously enhancing ecosystem net primary production. Thus, ecosystem water-use efficiency rose under conditions of simultaneously-elevated air temperature and CO 2 concentration. In addition, the air temperature increase had little effect on soil organic carbon content, boosting it by only 1%. Doubling the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, on the other hand, increased soil carbon storage by 5%; and when both air temperature and CO 2 concentration were increased together, the simulated increase in soil carbon content was a full 10%. What it means",3.3,3.3,2.3,"Reasoning: The text discusses the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on ecosystem evapotranspiration, net primary production, and soil carbon storage, but does not make any direct claims about the role of greenhouse gases in driving climate change. Therefore, Code 2.3 is the most applicable as it suggests a lack of evidence for the greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide driving climate change.",3.2,"```

The main claim of this text is that increasing air temperature and CO2 concentration can have beneficial effects on ecosystems, such as increasing water-use efficiency and soil carbon storage.

The evidence provided is the results of a simulation or experiment that showed these effects.

2. Based on this, the text matches code 5.2 because:
The text implies that environmental alarmists, including those concerned about climate change, are wrong or overreacting. The tone is dismissive and critical of Ehrlich and others who sound the alarm about environmental issues. This matches the codebook category 5.2, which describes texts that portray the climate movement as alarmist, wrong, political, biased, or hypocritical."
16,What happens to an air parcel when a CO 2 molecule absorbs an IR photon? Since the molecule can only exist in specific discrete energy states it jumps to a higher (excited) energy state. However in this process the translational energy of the CO 2 molecule does not change. The average speed of the molecules of the air parcel containing this CO 2 molecule has not increased. Since temperature is related to the root mean square speed of the molecules the temperature of the air parcel does not increase. CO 2 does not trap heat.,2.3,2.3,2.3,"Reasoning: The text is denying the greenhouse effect and stating that CO2 does not trap heat. This aligns with code 2.3, which states that there is no evidence for greenhouse effect/carbon dioxide driving climate change.",2.3,"```

Here is the analysis:

1. Main claim and evidence:
The main claim is that Bangladesh is ahead of other countries in terms of adaptation to climate change. The evidence is the author's 10-year experience working on adaptation in Least Developed Countries of Africa and Asia.

2. Based on this, the text matches code 0.0 because:
The text does not express any skepticism or denial of climate change. Instead, it discusses adaptation efforts, implying that climate change is a real issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, it does not fit into any of the categories that represent climate change skepticism or denial."
40,"Denmark was responsible in 2010 for about 0.15% of the worlds human emissions of CO2. Global temperatures by 2100 should rise by less than 3C. If their emissions dont change, the Danes are therefore likely to be responsible for up to about 3 0.0015 = 0.0045C of that global temperature rise, which nobody will detect in the environment. For that undetectable reward, they will endure much.",4.2,0.0,2.5,"2.5 - The text suggests that Denmark's emissions of CO2 are miniscule and not significant enough to cause a detectable impact on global temperature rise. This aligns with code 2.5, which states that human CO2 emissions are miniscule/not raising atmospheric CO2.",3.4,"```

Here's the analysis:

1. Main claim and evidence:
The main claim is that Denmark's CO2 emissions will have a negligible impact on global temperature rise. The evidence is a calculation that shows Denmark's emissions would contribute to a temperature rise of only 0.0045C, which is undetectable in the environment.

2. Based on this, the text matches code 3.4 because:
The text argues that the temperature rise associated with Denmark's CO2 emissions is very small (only 0.0045C) and therefore not significant. This matches code 3.4, which corresponds to the claim that climate change is only a few degrees (or less)."

Here is the analysis:

1. Main claim and evidence:
The main claim is that James Cameron is a hypocrite when it comes to climate change, as he preaches about the importance of combating climate change but his lifestyle does not reflect this. The evidence is a short film released by supporters of Proposition 23, which allegedly highlights the discrepancy between Cameron's words and actions.

2. Based on this, the text matches code 5.2 because:
The text is criticizing James Cameron, a prominent figure in the climate movement, for being hypocritical about climate change. This falls under the category of ""Climate movement is alarmist/wrong/political/biased/hypocritical"" (5.2)."

It is still estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 C for a doubling of CO2. And what Roy has addressed here is the fact that this is probably a faulty estimate because they have not taken into account the reduced feedback, perhaps even negative feedback, of water vapor and reduced, perhaps even negative feedback of clouds.

**Answer:**

1. Main claim and evidence:
The main claim is that the outgoing longwave radiation declines at a rate of about -0.1 watts/m^2/decade from 1861 to 2005, with a spread of about 0.15 watts/m^2/decade among different models. The evidence is the model mean and the range of trends from the slowest to the fastest decline.

2. Based on this, the text matches code 5.1 because:
The text presents a scientific analysis of climate data, discussing the decline of outgoing longwave radiation and the spread of trends among different models. This text does not contain any claims or arguments that contradict or downplay the reality of climate change, but rather presents a neutral, scientific analysis of climate data. Therefore, it matches code 5.1, which indicates that the text presents uncertain or unsound science, but in this case, it's a neutral presentation of scientific data rather than an argument against climate change."
82,"Increased Svalbard Glacial acceleration started suddenly in 2012, was limited to one continental glacier, occurred in only one portion of the Austfonna ice cap, was verified to NOT occur in the adjacent Vestfonna ice cap, and has not been documented elsewhere in the island chain (Figure 3).",0.0,0.0,1.1,"1.1 - The text mentions ice/glaciers and their behavior, specifically the acceleration of a glacier in Svalbard.

If one is insignificant, then the other one is, too.",1.1,1.1,1.1,"Reasoning: The text mentions the record growth of sea ice around Antarctica, which suggests that the author is arguing against the idea that ice is melting due to climate change. The code 1.1 specifically addresses this argument.",1.6,"```
The main claim of the text is that Al Gore has selectively presented data on sea ice melting in the Arctic while ignoring the record growth of sea ice around Antarctica. The evidence presented is a link to a website maintained by the University of Illinois-Urbana that shows the maximum historic sea ice in Antarctica in 2007.

Based on this, the text matches code 1.6 because it presents a counterargument to the claim of sea level rise by highlighting the growth of sea ice around Antarctica, which is often cited as evidence of climate change."
84,"The difficulty for plaintiffs in all of these climate change lawsuits is that their legal theories have little basis in positive law or judicial precedent.

86,"The ACWT record, to quote the authors, reveals the existence of ""two distinct warm periods from the late 1920s to 1950s and in the late 1980s-90s and two cold periods, one at the beginning of the record (until the 1920s) and another in the 1960s-70s."" The SAT record depicts essentially the same thing, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period being not quite as high as the peak temperature of the former warm period. In the case of the ACWT record, this relationship is reversed, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period slightly exceeding the peak temperature of the former warm period; however, the most recent maximum temperature is very short-lived and rapidly declines to hover around a value that is about 1C cooler over the last few years of the record. What it means",2.1,2.1,1.4,"1.4 - The text mentions that ""climate hasn't warmed/changed over the last (few) decade(s)"" by discussing temperature records from the ACWT and SAT.

This aligns with code 2.1, which states that climate change is due to natural cycles and variation. The mention of remaining agnostic also suggests a lack of belief in human-caused climate change, which further supports this code.",2.1,"```
The main claim of this text is that the warming on other planets and Earth could be attributed to natural causes, such as the Sun and/or cosmic rays, or internal planetary variability, rather than human-induced climate change. The evidence presented is the shared positive sign in most cases, which is suggestive but not conclusive.

Based on this, the text matches code 2.1 because it suggests that climate change is due to natural cycles or variation, rather than human activities."

96,"It's remarkable that she doesn't even dare to consider the correct explanation - namely one that the data she has collected are actually real rather than sequences of errors of measurements or results of a world-wide conspiracy. Men are statistically better physicists, better physics teachers, better actors, and - yes - better judges of the quality of their teachers, too - and her research is just another way to see that it is so.",0.0,5.1,5.2,"Reasoning: The text is criticizing a female researcher's work and suggesting that men are better at physics and judging the quality of their teachers. This implies a bias against women and a belief in gender stereotypes, which aligns with the code 5.2 for the climate movement being biased. The mention of a ""world-wide conspiracy"" also hints at a belief in conspiracy theories, which is another characteristic of code 5.3, but the focus on gender bias makes 5.2 the most applicable code.",0.0,"```

This text does not match any of the categories in the codebook, as it does not discuss climate change or its impacts. The text appears to be a criticism of a researcher's work, arguing that the data they have collected is real and not the result of errors or conspiracy, and that men are better in various fields, including physics and judging teacher quality. Therefore, the correct answer is:

2. Based on this, the text matches code 0.0 because it does not discuss climate change or its impacts.

Code: 0.0
Reason: The text does not discuss climate change or its impacts."
97,"We now know that the progressives, despite their dissatisfaction with many elements of President Obama's agenda, largely won those fights. The result is that large segments of the American electorate feel that the administration and Democrats in Congress don't understand and don't care to understand their aspirations and fears. This sentiment is most keenly and strongly felt among conservative Republicans, but it is sharedfor different reasonsby many nonconservatives. This sentiment is particularly strong among the white working class and among Catholics.",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The text does not mention anything related to climate change or any of the codes in the codebook. Therefore, none of the codes apply.",0.0,"```

The main claim of this text is that large segments of the American electorate feel that the administration and Democrats in Congress don't understand and don't care to understand their aspirations and fears. The evidence provided is that this sentiment is most keenly and strongly felt among conservative Republicans, but it is shared for different reasons by many non-conservatives, particularly among the white working class and among Catholics.

Based on this, the text matches code 0.0 because it does not discuss climate change at all. The text appears to be discussing politics and public opinion, rather than climate change."
98,"Yes, and it was getting warmer when the First World War broke out. And didnt Napoleon start his campaigns in Winter a lot? And last week, during that cold snap, a fight broke out at the local pub. Maybe that was caused by climate change.",0.0,2.1,1.3,"1.3 - The text mentions cold weather and snowing, which aligns with the code for ""Weather is cold/snowing.""",1.7,"```

Here is the analysis:

1. Main claim and evidence:
The main claim is that climate change is not real or not a significant issue. The evidence provided is anecdotal and unrelated to climate change, such as Napoleon's campaigns in winter, a cold snap, and a fight at a local pub.

2. Based on this, the text matches code 1.7 because:
The text suggests that extreme weather events, such as cold snaps, are not linked to climate change and have happened before, implying that climate change is not a significant factor in extreme weather events."
99,"A paper published today in the Journal of Climate finds that ensembles of climate models used by the IPCC to predict future climate change""may lead to overly confident climate predictions."" The authors find that many models share the same computer code, have the same limitations, and ""tend to be fairly similar,"" resulting in confirmation bias. Indeed, empirical observations have shown far less warming than the ""90% confident"" IPCC models in AR4, as shown in this poster by John Christy:",5.1,5.1,5.1,"The text discusses a paper that questions the accuracy of climate models used by the IPCC to predict future climate change. This suggests uncertainty and unreliability in climate-related science, which falls under code 5.1. The text does not mention any other codes related to climate change denial or skepticism.",5.1,"```
The main claim of the text is that climate models used by the IPCC are overly confident and may lead to incorrect predictions. The evidence provided is that many models share the same computer code and limitations, resulting in confirmation bias, and that empirical observations have shown less warming than predicted by the IPCC models.

Based on this, the text matches code 5.1 because it questions the reliability of climate models and the science behind them, suggesting that the predictions are uncertain or unsound."
