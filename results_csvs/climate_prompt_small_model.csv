The text implies that Apple's decision was incorrect and now acknowledges it as a mistake, suggesting that their previous stance on environmental issues was flawed."
6,"Rather than one guess being applicable to all measurements, I ended up needing four different groups each with a different guessed deflation. A good guess (i.e. one that worked) for the majority of balls (7) was 0.38 psi an interesting number that Ill discuss in the post. A good guess for two balls was zero deflation. But for ball #7, it was necessary to assume that it had been inflated by approximately 0.5 psiin the washroom. One ball was lower than the others (0.76 psi) and remains hard to explain. The Wells Report reasonably drew attention to variability, but did not address the details of actual variability other than arm-waving and did not actually show that erratic washroom deflation was a plausible explanation for observed variability.",0.0,0.0,0.0,Reasoning: The text does not mention anything related to climate change or any of the codes in the codebook.,5.1,"This code fits because the text questions the reliability and accuracy of climate-related science, implying uncertainty about the data or methods used to measure changes in ice cover (or more broadly, climate change). The mention of ""variability"" and ""erratic washroom deflation"" as potential explanations for observed variability suggests skepticism towards the scientific consensus on climate change."
7,Obama Targets GOP States With Costly CO2 Regulations,4.1,4.1,4.1,"Reasoning: The text suggests that Obama's CO2 regulations are targeting GOP states and are costly, indicating a negative view of climate policies. Code 4.1 specifically addresses the belief that climate policies (mitigation or adaptation) are harmful, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the text.",4.5,"This code fits because the main claim implies that people need energy (in this case, fossil fuels), and the text suggests that Obama's CO2 regulations are an attempt to restrict access to energy sources, which is a common argument made by those who oppose climate change policies. The text does not explicitly argue for or against climate change itself, but rather presents it as a political issue, making 4.5 the most appropriate code."

The text acknowledges that this event does not invalidate the case for global warming, but it does suggest that climate researchers are human and prone to bias. This aligns with code 5.2, which pertains to skepticism of the climate movement and its perceived biases.",5.2,"This code fits best because the text implies that the Climategate scandal is being used to discredit the entire field of climate science, suggesting that it's alarmist or biased. The text also mentions a book titled ""Climate Confusion?"", which further suggests a skeptical tone towards climate change."
12,"Increasing the air temperature by 2C increased ecosystem evapotranspiration ; but the imposition of twice-ambient atmospheric CO 2 concentrations reduced this impact of the temperature increase while simultaneously enhancing ecosystem net primary production. Thus, ecosystem water-use efficiency rose under conditions of simultaneously-elevated air temperature and CO 2 concentration. In addition, the air temperature increase had little effect on soil organic carbon content, boosting it by only 1%. Doubling the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, on the other hand, increased soil carbon storage by 5%; and when both air temperature and CO 2 concentration were increased together, the simulated increase in soil carbon content was a full 10%. What it means",3.3,3.3,2.3,"Reasoning: The text discusses the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on ecosystem evapotranspiration, net primary production, and soil carbon storage, but does not make any direct claims about the role of greenhouse gases in driving climate change. Therefore, Code 2.3 is the most applicable as it suggests a lack of evidence for the greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide driving climate change.",3.5,"This code fits best because the text explicitly states that human CO2 emissions (i.e., increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations) have a significant impact on ecosystem processes, such as evapotranspiration and net primary production, while also affecting soil carbon storage. The text presents evidence of these effects in a neutral or even positive light, suggesting that human CO2 emissions are not minuscule or negligible, but rather have measurable and significant impacts on ecosystems."
13,"I attended these events on the Mall that weekend and found them to be a wonderful antidote to the green hype of Live Earth and, in truth, a better example of true conservation and simple living then the giant rock concerts were. They were a sort of anti-rock festival, with informal singing and craftsmanship taking precedence. And for bizarre reasons, the Folklife Festival itself has itself actually come under attack from the greens. I will share my impressions and get into the controversy later. In the meantime, back to Gore's lies.",0.0,0.0,5.2,"The text mentions ""Gore's lies"" and refers to the events on the Mall as an ""antidote to the green hype of Live Earth."" This suggests a skepticism or criticism of the climate movement and its leaders, which aligns with code 5.2. Additionally, the mention of controversy surrounding the Folklife Festival suggests a potential political bias or conflict, further supporting the choice of code 5.2.",4.1,"This code fits because the text claims that climate policies (in this case, the environmental movement) are harmful or counterproductive to conservation efforts. The author's criticism of the environmental movement and their support for alternative approaches suggests that they believe climate policies are not effective or beneficial."
14,"In summing up their discussion of the subject, therefore, Laxon et al. simply state that their results ???show that errors are present in current simulations of Arctic sea ice,?? and they thus conclude, in the closing sentence of their paper, that ???until models properly reproduce the observed high-frequency, and thermodynamically driven, variability in sea ice thickness, simulations of both recent, and future, changes in Arctic ice cover will be open to question.??",5.1,5.1,5.1,"The text does not make any claims about the causes or impacts of climate change, but rather discusses the accuracy of current simulations of Arctic sea ice.

This aligns with code 5.1, which indicates that climate-related science is uncertain or unreliable."
15,"Population pressures were and remain a genuine environmental concern, but it gradually became clear that Ehrlich and other alarmists had way overestimated the problem, and it looks very different today. (Indeed, the great social problem of the end of this century may be population that is falling too rapidly.) And while Ehrlich is still peddling the same Malthusian gloom, he never turns up on the Tonight Show any more; in fact, he doesn't even make it on Hardball or Countdown with Krazy Keith.",0.0,5.2,0.0,0.0 - This text does not mention any of the codes in the codebook related to climate change.,4.5,"This code fits because the text suggests that people still need energy (in this case, fossil fuels), and implies that climate change mitigation efforts are not necessary or effective. The author's tone is dismissive of Ehrlich's alarmism, implying that there is no urgent need for drastic action to address population pressures."
16,What happens to an air parcel when a CO 2 molecule absorbs an IR photon? Since the molecule can only exist in specific discrete energy states it jumps to a higher (excited) energy state. However in this process the translational energy of the CO 2 molecule does not change. The average speed of the molecules of the air parcel containing this CO 2 molecule has not increased. Since temperature is related to the root mean square speed of the molecules the temperature of the air parcel does not increase. CO 2 does not trap heat.,2.3,2.3,2.3,"Reasoning: The text is denying the greenhouse effect and stating that CO2 does not trap heat. This aligns with code 2.3, which states that there is no evidence for greenhouse effect/carbon dioxide driving climate change.",3.4,"This code fits because the text explicitly states that CO2 does not trap heat, and by extension, it suggests that climate change is not happening or is less severe than claimed. The main claim is supported by a specific scientific explanation, which aligns with the idea that temperature changes are minimal (only a slight increase in translational energy)."

Instead, it appears to be a non-sequitur or an attempt to distract from the topic of climate change. Therefore, none of the above codes (1.x) apply, and the correct code is 0.0, indicating that the text does not match any specific claim about climate change."
18,"Just add sea ice onto the growing list of variables that are simulated poorly by the IPCCs climate models. Over the past few months, weve illustrated and discussed that the climate models stored in the CMIP5 archive for the upcoming 5 th Assessment Report (AR5) cannot simulate observed:",5.1,5.1,1.1,"1.1 - The text mentions that sea ice is not being simulated accurately by climate models, which suggests that the conservative blog post may argue that ice cover isn't melting.",1.6,"The text directly challenges the accuracy of climate models in simulating sea ice, which is a key indicator of climate change. This matches code 1.6 because it suggests that sea level rise is exaggerated or not accelerating, implying that climate models are flawed in their predictions."
19,"Answer: Almost certainly nothing , for the same reasons as above, and also since CO2 is unlikely to be revealed as the main driver (or even one of the main drivers) of global warming.",2.3,2.3,2.3,"The text suggests that there is no evidence for CO2 driving climate change, which aligns with code 2.3. The text also mentions that CO2 is unlikely to be the main driver of global warming, further supporting this code.",3.5,"The text attributes the uncertainty about CO2's role in global warming to a lack of clear evidence or revelation, which aligns with code 3.5's claim that human CO2 emissions are miniscule and not raising atmospheric CO2. This code fits because it suggests that the issue is not the magnitude of CO2 emissions but rather the perceived significance or impact of those emissions on global warming."
20,"From an op-ed in today's WSJ titled ""In Defense of Carbon Dioxide"" by Harrison Schmitt, an adjunct professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, an Apollo 17 astronaut, and a former U.S. senator from New Mexico; and William Happer, professor of physics at Princeton University and a former director of the office of energy research at the U.S. Department of Energy:",0.0,3.3,3.3,"The text mentions an op-ed defending carbon dioxide, arguing that it is beneficial and not a pollutant. This aligns with code 3.3, which states that CO2 is beneficial and not a pollutant.",3.3,"This code fits best because the authors explicitly state that CO2 is beneficial, which directly contradicts the notion that it's a pollutant causing harmful climate change. Additionally, they mention natural cycles and imply that small amounts of warming won't be catastrophic, aligning with code 3.4 (It's only a few degrees)."

We need to separate these results of model experiments - of course that's all they are are experiments with models, from scenarios of how CO2 will increase. These are two separate issues. As far as I can tell from the IPCC report, their estimate or their numbers for the what is call the ""climate sensitivity"" that is, how much temperature rise will be produced by doubling of CO2 alone, all other things being equal, has not changed since 1990. It is still estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 C for a doubling of CO2. And what Roy has addressed here is the fact that this is probably a faulty estimate because they have not taken into account the reduced feedback, perhaps even negative feedback, of water vapor and reduced, perhaps even negative feedback of clouds.

The text also mentions that ascribing greenhouse effect properties to the Earth's atmosphere is not scientifically substantiated, further supporting the choice of code 2.3."
78,"The reality is that, except in the most general terms, we are unable to satisfactorily explain past variations of climate. Over the recent 2 million years why did the primary mode of climate oscillation change from a 40,000 year (axial tilt) periodicity to one close to 100,000 years (linked to eccentricity)? And how do we explain the recent glacial cycles, given that annual solar insolation intercepted by the Earths disc changes little between near circular and more eccentric orbits? Even the relative regularity in value to which temperatures asymptote during each interglacial, as estimated from Antarctic ice cores, can hardly be attributed to chance yet does not have an explanation!",5.1,5.1,1.1,"The text discusses the uncertainty and lack of understanding surrounding past variations in climate, but it does not deny the existence of climate change or its current impacts. Therefore, code 1.1 is the most applicable as it suggests that ice, permafrost, and snow cover are not melting, which is not the focus of the text.",2.1,"The text attributes current climate change to natural variation, specifically referencing historical climate cycles and the complexity of past climate oscillations. This matches code 2.1 because it implies that current changes are part of a larger, natural pattern rather than being driven by human activities or greenhouse gas emissions."
79,"The CO2 emissions per capita are nearly proportional to the GDP per capita - but no one cares about this particular number, anyway. Costa Rica has something like 2 tons of CO2 per capita and year while the Netherlands has 23 tons or so. If you reduce your emissions to 1/10, your wealth will drop to 1/5 or so, which is about 0.7th power of 1/10.",4.1,4.1,2.5,"2.5 - The text suggests that reducing CO2 emissions would result in a significant decrease in wealth, implying that human CO2 emissions are not miniscule and do have an impact on the economy.",4.4,"The text presents a claim about the economic consequences of reducing CO2 emissions, suggesting that it would lead to a significant decrease in wealth (GDP per capita). This aligns with code 4.4, which states that ""Clean energy technology/biofuels won't work"" or, more broadly, that climate policies are ineffective. The text's focus on the economic impact of reducing emissions and its implication that it would have a significant negative effect on wealth suggests that it is arguing against the effectiveness of climate policies, making 4.4 the most appropriate code."

That is, theres a spread of about 0.15 watts/m^2/decade during the hindcast.",0.0,0.0,5.1,"Reasoning: The text discusses a model's mean of outgoing longwave radiation and its decline over time. This is related to climate science and modeling, which falls under the category of climate-related science. The text also mentions a spread in the data, which could be interpreted as a potential issue with the reliability of the data or models. Therefore, the most applicable code is 5.1, which pertains to uncertainty or unreliability in climate-related science.",3.1,"This code fits best because the text discusses the concept of ""climate sensitivity"" (i.e., how much the climate responds to a given amount of warming) and presents evidence that suggests it is low, as indicated by the range of decline rates among different models (-0.02 to -0.17 watts/m^2/decade). The mention of negative feedbacks also implies that the warming effect is being dampened, which aligns with the idea of low climate sensitivity."
82,"Increased Svalbard Glacial acceleration started suddenly in 2012, was limited to one continental glacier, occurred in only one portion of the Austfonna ice cap, was verified to NOT occur in the adjacent Vestfonna ice cap, and has not been documented elsewhere in the island chain (Figure 3).",0.0,0.0,1.1,"1.1 - The text mentions ice/glaciers and their behavior, specifically the acceleration of a glacier in Svalbard. However, it does not provide any evidence to suggest that this acceleration is due to climate change or that it is part of a larger trend. Therefore, the most applicable code is 1.1, which refers to the idea that ice/permafrost/snow cover isn't melting.",1.1,"This code fits best because the text directly claims that ice cover isn't melting, using selective evidence about a specific area (the one continental glacier) where acceleration did not occur, and verifying it didn't happen in another adjacent area (Vestfonna ice cap).

84,"The difficulty for plaintiffs in all of these climate change lawsuits is that their legal theories have little basis in positive law or judicial precedent.

86,"The ACWT record, to quote the authors, reveals the existence of ""two distinct warm periods from the late 1920s to 1950s and in the late 1980s-90s and two cold periods, one at the beginning of the record (until the 1920s) and another in the 1960s-70s."" The SAT record depicts essentially the same thing, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period being not quite as high as the peak temperature of the former warm period. In the case of the ACWT record, this relationship is reversed, with the peak temperature of the latter warm period slightly exceeding the peak temperature of the former warm period; however, the most recent maximum temperature is very short-lived and rapidly declines to hover around a value that is about 1C cooler over the last few years of the record. What it means",2.1,2.1,1.4,"1.4 - The text mentions that ""climate hasn't warmed/changed over the last (few) decade(s)"" by discussing temperature records from the ACWT and SAT.

89,"What's often ignored is that the creation of green jobs through subsidies and regulation inherently leads to the destruction of job opportunities in other industries. That's because any resource forcibly taken out of one sector and politically allocated in favor of renewable energy cannot be invested elsewhere. In our country, green energies are subsidized through a premium that every electricity consumer pays on his electricity bill (about 4.3% of the average bill). That helps to make Italy's electricity costs among the most expensive in Europe. In particular, big industrial consumers pay the most for electricity in Europe (at least 25% above the EU average in 2008, according to Italy's energy regulator).",4.1,4.1,4.1,"Reasoning: The text argues that climate policies, specifically the creation of green jobs through subsidies and regulation, lead to the destruction of job opportunities in other industries. This aligns with code 4.1, which states that climate policies (mitigation or adaptation) are harmful.",4.4,"This code fits best because the text argues that a specific policy (subsidies for green jobs) has an unintended negative consequence (job destruction in other industries), which is consistent with the claim made in code 4.4, ""Clean energy technology/biofuels won't work"" is not correct here but the idea of unintended consequences and costs associated with subsidies fits better with this category."
