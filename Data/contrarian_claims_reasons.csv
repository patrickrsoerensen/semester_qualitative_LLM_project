6,"Rather than one guess being applicable to all measurements, I ended up needing four different groups each with a different guessed deflation. A good guess (i.e. one that worked) for the majority of balls (7) was 0.38 psi an interesting number that Ill discuss in the post. A good guess for two balls was zero deflation. But for ball #7, it was necessary to assume that it had been inflated by approximately 0.5 psiin the washroom. One ball was lower than the others (0.76 psi) and remains hard to explain. The Wells Report reasonably drew attention to variability, but did not address the details of actual variability other than arm-waving and did not actually show that erratic washroom deflation was a plausible explanation for observed variability.",0.0,0.0,0.0,Reasoning: The text does not mention anything related to climate change or any of the codes in the codebook.

The text acknowledges that this event does not invalidate the case for global warming, but it does suggest that climate researchers are human and prone to bias. This aligns with code 5.2, which pertains to skepticism of the climate movement and its perceived biases."
12,"Increasing the air temperature by 2C increased ecosystem evapotranspiration ; but the imposition of twice-ambient atmospheric CO 2 concentrations reduced this impact of the temperature increase while simultaneously enhancing ecosystem net primary production. Thus, ecosystem water-use efficiency rose under conditions of simultaneously-elevated air temperature and CO 2 concentration. In addition, the air temperature increase had little effect on soil organic carbon content, boosting it by only 1%. Doubling the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, on the other hand, increased soil carbon storage by 5%; and when both air temperature and CO 2 concentration were increased together, the simulated increase in soil carbon content was a full 10%. What it means",3.3,3.3,2.3,"Reasoning: The text discusses the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on ecosystem evapotranspiration, net primary production, and soil carbon storage, but does not make any direct claims about the role of greenhouse gases in driving climate change. Therefore, Code 2.3 is the most applicable as it suggests a lack of evidence for the greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide driving climate change."
13,"I attended these events on the Mall that weekend and found them to be a wonderful antidote to the green hype of Live Earth and, in truth, a better example of true conservation and simple living then the giant rock concerts were. They were a sort of anti-rock festival, with informal singing and craftsmanship taking precedence. And for bizarre reasons, the Folklife Festival itself has itself actually come under attack from the greens. I will share my impressions and get into the controversy later. In the meantime, back to Gore's lies.",0.0,0.0,5.2,"The text mentions ""Gore's lies"" and refers to the events on the Mall as an ""antidote to the green hype of Live Earth."" This suggests a skepticism or criticism of the climate movement and its leaders, which aligns with code 5.2.

14,"In summing up their discussion of the subject, therefore, Laxon et al. simply state that their results ???show that errors are present in current simulations of Arctic sea ice,?? and they thus conclude, in the closing sentence of their paper, that ???until models properly reproduce the observed high-frequency, and thermodynamically driven, variability in sea ice thickness, simulations of both recent, and future, changes in Arctic ice cover will be open to question.??",5.1,5.1,5.1,"The text does not make any claims about the causes or impacts of climate change, but rather discusses the accuracy of current simulations of Arctic sea ice. The mention of ""simulations"" and ""models"" suggests a focus on the scientific methods and data used to study climate change, which aligns with code 5.1 for uncertainty in climate-related science."
15,"Population pressures were and remain a genuine environmental concern, but it gradually became clear that Ehrlich and other alarmists had way overestimated the problem, and it looks very different today. (Indeed, the great social problem of the end of this century may be population that is falling too rapidly.)

16,What happens to an air parcel when a CO 2 molecule absorbs an IR photon? Since the molecule can only exist in specific discrete energy states it jumps to a higher (excited) energy state. However in this process the translational energy of the CO 2 molecule does not change. The average speed of the molecules of the air parcel containing this CO 2 molecule has not increased. Since temperature is related to the root mean square speed of the molecules the temperature of the air parcel does not increase. CO 2 does not trap heat.,2.3,2.3,2.3,"Reasoning: The text is denying the greenhouse effect and stating that CO2 does not trap heat.

41,"Thats where we are now with GHGs. We are going to get more or less GHG regulation over time depending on who is in the White House and whether the particular GHG regulations that EPA issues are legally defensible. Thus, each regulation is going to have to be attacked (or defended) on the merits. My own view is that EPAs latest GHG proposal, for new source performance standards for coal-based electric generation, is not legally defensible and will be overturned in Court.

48,JC comment: The first sentence of the abstract really caught my attention: Given that over the course of the next 1030 years the magnitude of natural decadal variations may rival that of anthropogenically forced climate change on regional scales I dont recall the climate establishment giving this one before. The implications of this is that the warming between 1970 or 1980 to 2000 should be operating under the same givens also.,2.1,0.0,2.1,"Reasoning: The text suggests that the author believes that climate change is a result of natural cycles and variations, rather than human activity. The statement about natural decadal variations rivaling anthropogenic climate change supports this interpretation.

We need to separate these results of model experiments - of course that's all they are are experiments with models, from scenarios of how CO2 will increase. These are two separate issues. As far as I can tell from the IPCC report, their estimate or their numbers for the what is call the ""climate sensitivity"" that is, how much temperature rise will be produced by doubling of CO2 alone, all other things being equal, has not changed since 1990. It is still estimated to be between 1.5 and 4.5 C for a doubling of CO2. And what Roy has addressed here is the fact that this is probably a faulty estimate because they have not taken into account the reduced feedback, perhaps even negative feedback, of water vapor and reduced, perhaps even negative feedback of clouds. So the climate sensitivity is the one we are interested in. I think many of us believe that these numbers, that the IPCC has given, are just plain wrong.",3.1,5.1,2.3,"The text is questioning the evidence for the greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide driving climate change, which falls under code 2.3.
